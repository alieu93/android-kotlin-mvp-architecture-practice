# Android Kotlin MVP Architecture Practice

The purpose of this is to simply practice MVP Architecture using interfaces and contracts alongside the use of the Kotlin language to make a simple TO DO list app in order to learn more recent design paradigms. 

Further extensions of this code base beyond of the "practice" purpose for strictly MVP, Kotlin and generic android functionality will be explored in separate repos.
